# u2dl

The smallest YouTube downloader in the world, coming in at 1652 bytes. Downloads full-quality videos from YouTube.

## Pros
- It's small (1652 bytes!!!)
- Written in fish and standard Unix tooling
- Bypasses the "rolling cipher" with [Advanced Technologyâ„¢](https://github.com/knownunown/u2dl/blob/833fd5d0debda4b49b3748f3aab6d0fcdf7e5337/u2dl.fish#L82-L96)

## Cons
- Doesn't download Widevine/DRM protected videos (but you knew that already, right?)
- Doesn't allow for format selection
